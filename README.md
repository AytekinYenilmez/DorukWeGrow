# WeGrow â€” Skorveri-style English Site

A clean Next.js + Tailwind CSS implementation inspired by the layout and sections of **skorveri.com.tr**, but written from scratch and in English.

## Quickstart
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000

## Customize
- Replace placeholder texts, phone, and email in components.
- Replace logo boxes in `components/Clients.tsx` with actual SVGs or images.
- Add real images into `/public` and use them in Hero/Cards as needed.
- Flesh out each product page under `/app/products/*`.

## Notes
This project is original code and does *not* copy any proprietary assets (images, text, or styles) from the reference. It recreates a similar information architecture and UX.
